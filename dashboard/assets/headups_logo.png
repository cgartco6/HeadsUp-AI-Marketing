But note: the `content_creator.py` expects `assets/sample_receipt.jpg` to exist. So if the user does not add it, the script will fail. We can add a check in the code? Let's adjust `content_creator.py`:

```python
import os

# ...

def generate_content(platform, business_tier, language="English"):
    """Creates 15-sec demo videos/GIFs showing receipt scanning"""
    # Check if sample receipt exists
    receipt_path = "assets/sample_receipt.jpg"
    if not os.path.exists(receipt_path):
        # Use a placeholder image
        receipt_path = "https://via.placeholder.com/400x200?text=Add+Your+Receipt+Image"
    
    # Step 1: Simulate receipt scanning
    scan_visual = ImageClip(receipt_path).set_duration(3)
    
    # ... rest of the code ...
